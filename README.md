# Sticky

Some sticky elements may contain content that doesn't fit within the viewport
height. This script alters the behavior of sticky elements by making them sticky
at the bottom, instead of the top, when needed. An element will be sticky once
the user reached the bottom of the element, but only when it expands the
viewport height. Otherwise it will use the default `position: sticky;` behavior.

Why? Well if the content is expanding the viewport and it is sticky then a user
never ever will see the bottom content within the element.

## Usage

Just create an element (how you would normally do it) with the properties:

- `position: sticky;`
- `top: 20px;`

Call `.sticky()` on your element:

```js
$('#myElement').sticky();
```

## Options

##### options.defaultPosition

- `Default: 'relative'`

- This should be the position if you wouldn't use `position: sticky;`. If the
  element was positioned `absolute` then you would specify `absolute`. Otherwise
  `relative`.

```js
$('#myElement').sticky({ defaultPosition: 'relative' });
```

##### options.breakpoints

- `Default: '[{ min: 0, max: 768}]'`

- Allow to specify breakpoints where the script should be disabled. On default
  we specify a mobile breakpoint which is in-between 0-768. If the window width
  falls in-between those ranges, we disable our script.

Example: disable the script on mobile (0-768) and in-between 1000-1400 pixels:

```js
$('#myElement').sticky({
  defaultPosition: 'relative',
  breakpoints: [
    {
      min: 0,
      max: 768,
    },
    {
      min: 1000,
      max: 1400,
    },
  ],
});
```

To allow the script the check on mobile as well just pass in an empty array:

```js
$('#myElement').sticky({
  defaultPosition: 'relative',
  breakpoints: [],
});
```
